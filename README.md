Project: Tournament Results
---------------------------

Code for this project can be found in `vagrant/tournament`.

Within that directory, tests can be run with `python tournament_test.py`.

Tests assume that a database and tables have already been constructed. To do this, execute the `tournament.sql` script.

```
$ psql -f tournament.sql
```
